# Starbucks

Small system that allows a user to place an order. It will validate if the order can be processed or not.
At the end, it will apply taxes to the order based on the location of the store.

From visual studio code you can just press F5 and that will launch the application.
Then, there is a Postman folder inside where you can import a collection with different requests.
